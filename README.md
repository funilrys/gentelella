# gentelella

This fork exists to redesign and fix the broken structure of original *gentelella* project.

The origin of this work is in the issue [#406 Using & developing this template is a nightmare](https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella/issues/406)

## How to develop

1. Install all the dependencies `npm install && bower install`
2. Install **gulp globally** `npm install -g gulp`
3. Run the dev server simply calling `gulp`
4. Change the files!

## Theme Demo

The template demo can be found [here](http://gentelella.ilrysfun.com/) and is synchronized with this repository when needed.
